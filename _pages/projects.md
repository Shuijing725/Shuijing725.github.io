### Robot Sound Interpretation: Combining Sight and Sound in Learning-Based Control
We explore the interpretation of sound for robot decision-making, inspired by human speech comprehension.
While previous methods use natural language processing to translate sound to text, we propose an end-to-end
deep neural network which directly learns control polices from images and sound signals.

## Current projects

### Decentralized Human-Robot Interaction in Crowded Environment
To enable robots to achieve tasks in a real-world multi-agent environment (such as navigation, people following, etc), 
we want to develop a perception and decision making system that takes the interaction with other agents into account using 
machine learning technique. 

## Past projects

### Robot Sound Interpretation: Combining Sight and Sound in Learning-Based Control
We explore the interpretation of sound for robot decision-making, inspired by human speech comprehension.
While previous methods use natural language processing to translate sound to text, we propose an end-to-end
deep neural network which directly learns control polices from images and sound signals.

### Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Attacks
We propose adversarial attacks for Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and then improves the robustness of these algorithms 
with adversarial training using these attacks. We found that this adversarial training of deep RL algorithms like Double-DQN 
and DDPG leads to significant increase in robustness to parameter variations in OpenAI Gym benchmarks.

### Prostate Cancer Diagnosis by Deep Learning
Nowsdays prostate cancer diagnosis by biopsy images requires expensive equipments and experienced trained pathologists.
With recent advances in computer vision and machine intelligence, we tackle this problem by classifying biopsy images into 
positive or negative classes using a state-of-art convolutional neural network called ResNet. We achieved around 82% accuracy 
on some datasets and further boosted the accuracy to nearly 100% by ensemble methods.

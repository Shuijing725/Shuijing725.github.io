I'm a fourth year PhD student in [Human-Centered Autonomy Lab](https://publish.illinois.edu/humancenteredautonomy/) in 
[Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu), 
[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu), 
advised by Professor [Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu).
 My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and robotics, and I also draw inspirations human-robot interaction. 
 I primarily focuses on autonomous navigation in crowded and interactive environments using learning-based methods.
 My long term goal is to enable robots to interact and collaborate with people in daily life.   
 
Previously, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in May 2018.

Research interests:

- Learning-based Robotics
- Human-Robot Interaction
- Multiagent Systems
- Machine Learning

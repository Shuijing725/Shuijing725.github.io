<div style="height: 20px;"></div> <!-- Adds a 15px gap -->
Welcome to my personal website! I'm a postdoc at UT Austin, 
advised by Prof. [Yuke Zhu](https://yukezhu.me/), Prof. [Peter Stone](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/), and Prof. [Joydeep Biswas](https://www.joydeepb.com/).
In 2024, I obtained my PhD from [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu), 
advised by Prof. [Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu).

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in May 2018. Before that, I was born and raised in [Zhengzhou](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zhengzhou,+Henan,+China/@34.7425008,113.4983694,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x35d76594f09b6a9d:0x7932ee19f4cced2c!8m2!3d34.7472499!4d113.62493!16zL20vMDFxOXpz?entry=ttu), China.


Research Interests:
---
My goal is to enable robots to move beyond tool -like roles and instead collaborate with us as partners.
Toward this vision, my research treats humans, the end-users and beneficiaries of robots, as essential stakeholders in robot learning. 
My work is centered around **in-the-wild learning and deployment of human-centered robotics** that infer and support human needs in the open world, operate robustly alongside human crowds,
and adapt efficiently through natural interactions with humans.

[**[CV]**](/files/Shuijing_Liu_cv_public.pdf)  [**[Research statement]**](/files/Research_statement_faculty_Shuijing_Liu.pdf)  [**[Teaching statement]**](/files/Teaching_statement_faculty_Shuijing_Liu.pdf)  [**[Service/DEI statement]**](/files/Service_DEI_statement_faculty_Shuijing_Liu.pdf)     

My long term vision is to establish **a foundamental human-centered robot learning paradigm** that empowers capable and socially aware robot partners in everyday life. 
Advancing human-centered robot learning requires expanding robot capabilities in human-centric tasks, training robots with data that reflect human values, and fostering trustworthy human–robot communication.
I advocate for robot learning from the people, with the people, and for the people.

Outreach
---
For junior PhD/Master/undergraduate students and potential collaborators: I dedicate 30 minutes every two weeks to offer mentorship/advising/help, especially for students from underrepresented groups or whoever is in need. 
Topics include but are not limited to AI/robotics/HRI research, graduate school application, career development, life, etc.
If you would like to chat with me, please fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrKp_LFAzOSeKd_V_cAKGZmH5hpAprnxb8cPDXMhhrhiWR5w/viewform?usp=sf_link) to schedule.

Miscellaneous

Navigating through an academic career is hard. Here're the quotes that empowers me from time to time:
- "The scary news is, you're on your own now. But the cool news is, you're on your own now." -- Taylor Swift
- "As you rise, many people will disapprove. Rise anyway." -- Prof. Heng Ji
- "People are asking, and I’m asking, what is my legacy? And I tell you, my legacy is my students. They worked hard, but they felt they were appreciated, and there was a sense of camaraderie and support for each other. I didn’t do it consciously, but I guess it came from my motherly instincts. And I’m still in contact with many of them—I worry about their children, the usual grandma!" -- Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy (who's also my academic grandma!)

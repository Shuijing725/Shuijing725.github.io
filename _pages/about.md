Hello, my name is Shuijing Liu. I'm a second year M.S. student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu), 
[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu), advised by Professor [Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu).
 My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and robotics, specifically in robotic perception and 
 decision making in crowded environments. My long term goal is to enable interactive robots to serve people in daily life.   
 
Previously, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in May 2018.

Research interests:

- Artificial Intelligence 
- Intelligent Robotics
- Human-Robot Interaction

I'm a first year PhD student in [HCA Lab](https://publish.illinois.edu/humancenteredautonomy/) in 
[Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu), 
[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu), 
advised by Professor [Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu).
 My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and robotics, and I also draw inspirations human-robot interaction. 
 My long term goal is to enable interactive robots to serve people in daily life.   
 
Previously, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in May 2018.

Research interests:

- Artificial Intelligence 
- Intelligent Robotics
- Human-Robot Interaction

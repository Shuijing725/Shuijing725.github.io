Welcome to my personal website! I'm a final year PhD student in [Human-Centered Autonomy Lab](https://publish.illinois.edu/humancenteredautonomy/) in 
[Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.illinois.edu), 
[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu), 
advised by Professor [Katherine Driggs-Campbell](https://krdc.web.illinois.edu).

My primary research interest is robotic systems that leverages on structured models to operate among humans.
My long term goal is to enable robots to interact and collaborate with people in daily life. I advocate for robot learning from the people, with the people, and for the people.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in May 2018. Before that, I was born and raised in [Zhengzhou](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zhengzhou,+Henan,+China/@34.7425008,113.4983694,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x35d76594f09b6a9d:0x7932ee19f4cced2c!8m2!3d34.7472499!4d113.62493!16zL20vMDFxOXpz?entry=ttu), China.
